System Check
Last, chance to check for any system inconsistencies. Perform database sanity and consistency checks for partially installed, missing and obsolete packages:
# dpkg -C

apt-mark showhold

sed -i 's/jessie/stretch/g' /etc/apt/sources.list

apt-get update

apt-get --simulate upgrade
# apt-get upgrade
# apt-get dist-upgrade

All done. Reboot your system.
